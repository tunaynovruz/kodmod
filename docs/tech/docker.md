# Docker
draft: true

- **Container:** Lightweight, standalone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run an application.
- **Image:** Read-only template used to create containers, containing application code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files.
- **Dockerfile:** Text document containing instructions to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub:** Cloud-based registry service for sharing and managing container images.
- **Docker Compose:** Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using YAML files.
- **Docker Swarm:** Native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker.
- **Volume:** Persistent data storage mechanism that exists outside the container lifecycle.
- **Network:** Communication system that allows containers to communicate with each other and the outside world.
- **Registry:** Storage and distribution system for Docker images.

## Key Concepts

### Container vs Virtual Machine

| Feature | Container | Virtual Machine |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Virtualization | OS-level virtualization | Hardware-level virtualization |
| Size | Lightweight (MBs) | Heavy (GBs) |
| Boot time | Seconds | Minutes |
| Performance | Near-native | Overhead due to hypervisor |
| Isolation | Process isolation | Complete isolation |
| OS | Shares host OS kernel | Requires full OS |
| Resource usage | Efficient | Higher resource consumption |

### Docker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture:
- **Docker Client:** Command-line interface for interacting with Docker
- **Docker Daemon:** Background service that manages Docker objects
- **Docker Registry:** Stores Docker images
- **Docker Objects:** Images, containers, networks, volumes, etc.

## Common Docker Commands

```bash
# Run a container
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers (including stopped)
docker ps -a

# Build an image from a Dockerfile
docker build -t image_name:tag .

# Pull an image from Docker Hub
docker pull image_name:tag

# Push an image to Docker Hub
docker push image_name:tag

# Stop a running container
docker stop container_id

# Remove a container
docker rm container_id

# Remove an image
docker rmi image_id

# View container logs
docker logs container_id
```

## Use Cases

- **Microservices Architecture:** Deploying and scaling individual services independently
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment:** Consistent environments across development, testing, and production
- **Development Environments:** Creating isolated, reproducible development environments
- **Application Isolation:** Running multiple applications with different dependencies on the same host
- **Legacy Application Migration:** Containerizing legacy applications for easier management
- **Hybrid Cloud Deployments:** Consistent deployment across different cloud providers

## Best Practices

- Use official base images when possible
- Keep images small and focused
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Don't run containers as root
- Use volumes for persistent data
- Implement health checks
- Tag images properly (don't rely on "latest")
- Use Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
