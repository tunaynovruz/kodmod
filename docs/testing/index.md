# Software Testing Fundamentals
draft: true

Software testing is a critical process in software development that ensures the quality, reliability, and performance of applications. This document provides an overview of key testing concepts and methodologies.

## Types of Testing

### Unit Testing
- Tests individual components or functions in isolation
- Verifies that each unit of code works as expected
- Fast execution and provides immediate feedback
- Examples: JUnit (Java), NUnit (.NET), Jest (JavaScript)

### Integration Testing
- Tests interactions between integrated components
- Verifies that different parts of the application work together
- Identifies interface defects between modules
- Examples: Spring Test, TestNG with REST Assured

### Functional Testing
- Tests the application against functional requirements
- Focuses on business requirements and user scenarios
- Examples: Selenium, Cucumber, Robot Framework

### Performance Testing
- Tests system behavior under various load conditions
- Measures response time, throughput, and resource utilization
- Examples: JMeter, Gatling, LoadRunner

### End-to-End Testing
- Tests the complete application flow from start to finish
- Simulates real user scenarios across the entire application
- Examples: Cypress, Selenium with Cucumber

## Testing Approaches

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Ensures code meets requirements and is testable

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
- Focuses on business behavior rather than implementation details
- Uses natural language constructs (Given-When-Then)
- Bridges communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Popular Testing Libraries and Frameworks

### Java
- JUnit: Standard unit testing framework
- Mockito: Mocking framework
- TestNG: Advanced testing framework with more features than JUnit
- Selenium: Web application testing

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Jest: Unit testing framework
- Mocha: Flexible testing framework
- Cypress: End-to-end testing framework

### Python
- pytest: Feature-rich testing framework
- unittest: Standard library testing framework
- Behave: BDD testing framework

## Testing Best Practices

1. Write testable code with proper separation of concerns
2. Follow the testing pyramid (more unit tests, fewer UI tests)
3. Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) to isolate components
4. Maintain test independence (tests should not depend on each other)
5. Keep tests fast, reliable, and maintainable
6. Use continuous integration to run tests automatically
