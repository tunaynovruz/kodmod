# Cucumber Testing

Cucumber supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) by allowing tests to be written in natural language that stakeholders can understand.

## Key Components of Cucumber

### Gherkin Language

Gherkin is the language used to write Cucumber tests. It uses a set of keywords to structure test scenarios:

- **Feature**: Describes a software feature and its business value
- **Scenario**: Describes a specific test case
- **Given**: Sets up the initial context (preconditions)
- **When**: Describes the action or event
- **Then**: Describes the expected outcome
- **And**, **But**: Used to add additional context, actions, or expectations

### Step Definitions

Step definitions connect Gherkin steps to code. They translate the plain language into executable code that performs the actual testing.

### Runners

Runners are used to execute Cucumber tests and can be configured to run specific features or scenarios.

## Example: Cucumber Feature File

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to be able to log in to the system
  So that I can access my account

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter username "john.doe" and password "password123"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message with my name

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter username "john.doe" and password "wrongpassword"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message "Invalid credentials"
    And I should remain on the login page
```

## Java Step Definitions

```java
@Given("I am on the login page")
public void i_am_on_the_login_page() {
    driver = new ChromeDriver();
    loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
    loginPage.navigate();
}

@When("I enter username {string} and password {string}")
public void i_enter_username_and_password(String username, String password) {
    loginPage.enterUsername(username);
    loginPage.enterPassword(password);
}

@Then("I should be redirected to the dashboard")
public void i_should_be_redirected_to_the_dashboard() {
    dashboardPage = new DashboardPage(driver);
    assertTrue(dashboardPage.isDisplayed());
}
```
</details>

## Setup

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
    <version>7.0.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Runner Class

<details>
<summary>Koda bax</summary>

```java
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
    features = "src/test/resources/features",
    glue = "com.example.stepdefinitions"
)
public class CucumberRunner {
}
```
</details>

## Best Practices

1. **Write from user perspective**
2. **Keep scenarios independent**
3. **Use business language**
4. **Keep features concise**
5. **Reuse step definitions**

## Advanced Cucumber Features

### Scenario Outlines

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Login with different user types
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter username "<username>" and password "<password>"
  And I click the login button
  Then I should be redirected to the "<landing_page>"
  
  Examples:
    | username      | password      | landing_page |
    | admin         | admin123      | admin-panel  |
    | customer      | customer123   | dashboard    |
    | support       | support123    | tickets      |
```

### Backgrounds

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a customer
    And my shopping cart is empty
    
  Scenario: Add item to cart
    When I add product "Laptop" to my cart
    Then my cart should contain 1 item
    
  Scenario: Remove item from cart
    Given I have added product "Laptop" to my cart
    When I remove product "Laptop" from my cart
    Then my cart should be empty
```
