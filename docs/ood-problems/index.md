# Object-Oriented Design Problems

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is a critical skill for software engineers. It involves designing systems using object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. This section covers common OOD problems that are frequently asked in technical interviews.

## Problem List

Here are the OOD problems covered in this section:

1. [URL Shortener](./url-shortener.md) - Design a system to shorten long URLs (using strategy pattern)
2. [Load Balancer](./load-balancer.md) - Design a load balancer to distribute incoming requests (using strategy pattern)
3. [Elevator System](./elevator-system.md) - Design an elevator system for a building
4. [Vending Machine](./vending-machine.md) - Design a vending machine with product selection and payment processing
5. [ATM System](./atm-system.md) - Design an ATM system with various banking operations
6. [Parking Lot](./parking-lot.md) - Design a parking lot system with different vehicle types and payment processing
7. [Money Transfer System](./money-transfer-system.md) - Design a system for transferring money between accounts
8. [Restaurant Management System](./restaurant-system.md) - Design a system for managing restaurant operations
9. [Movie Ticket Booking System](./movie-ticket-system.md) - Design a system for booking movie tickets
10. [Tic Tac Toe Game](./tic-tac-toe.md) - Design a Tic Tac Toe game with proper OO principles

## Approach to OOD Problems

When solving Object-Oriented Design problems, follow these steps:

1. **Clarify Requirements**: Understand what the system needs to do
2. **Define Core Objects**: Identify the main entities in the system
3. **Analyze Relationships**: Determine how objects interact with each other
4. **Identify Operations**: Define the key operations each object should support
5. **Design Patterns**: Apply appropriate design patterns where needed
6. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about error handling and edge cases
7. **Address Concurrency**: Consider thread safety where applicable

## Key OO Design Principles

- **Encapsulation**: Hide implementation details, expose only what's necessary
- **Inheritance**: Reuse code through class hierarchies
- **Polymorphism**: Allow objects to take different forms based on context
- **Abstraction**: Focus on essential features, ignore unnecessary details
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class should have only one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
