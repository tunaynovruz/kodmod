## Component Design

### Document Editing Flow
1. User opens a document through web/mobile client
2. Application server authenticates and authorizes the request
3. Document Service retrieves the document from Document DB
4. Client establishes WebSocket connection with Collaboration Service
5. Presence Service tracks active users in the document
6. User makes edits which are:
   - Applied locally immediately
   - Sent to Collaboration Service as operations
   - Transformed against concurrent operations (OT)
   - Broadcast to all connected clients
   - Persisted to Document DB
7. Version Service periodically creates snapshots for version history

### Operational Transformation (OT)
- Core algorithm for maintaining consistency in collaborative editing
- Each edit is represented as an operation (insert, delete, format)
- Operations are transformed against concurrent operations to resolve conflicts
- Ensures convergence (all clients end up with the same document state)
- Example:
  ```
  User A: Insert "X" at position 5
  User B: Delete character at position 3
  
  After transformation:
  User A's operation becomes: Insert "X" at position 4 (adjusted for B's delete)
  User B's operation remains: Delete character at position 3
  ```

### Conflict Resolution Mechanism
1. Each operation has a unique ID and timestamp
2. Operations are ordered by timestamp
3. Conflicting operations are transformed using OT rules
4. System maintains a history of operations for each document
5. Clients can replay operations to reach the current state

## Database Design

### Document Database (MongoDB/Firestore)
- Stores document content, metadata, and access control
- Schema:
  ```
  Users {
    userId: string (primary key)
    email: string
    name: string
    ...other user attributes
  }
  
  Documents {
    documentId: string (primary key)
    title: string
    ownerId: string (foreign key to Users)
    createdAt: datetime
    lastModifiedAt: datetime
    lastModifiedBy: string (foreign key to Users)
    documentType: string (text, spreadsheet, presentation)
    content: object (current document state)
    version: int (current version number)
  }
  
  DocumentAccess {
    documentId: string (composite key with userId)
    userId: string (composite key with documentId)
    accessLevel: string (view, comment, edit)
    sharedBy: string (foreign key to Users)
    sharedAt: datetime
  }
  
  Operations {
    operationId: string (primary key)
    documentId: string (foreign key to Documents)
    userId: string (foreign key to Users)
    timestamp: datetime
    version: int (document version when operation was applied)
    operation: object (operation details - type, position, content)
    parentOperationIds: array<string> (operations this one depends on)
  }
  
  Comments {
    commentId: string (primary key)
    documentId: string (foreign key to Documents)
    userId: string (foreign key to Users)
    content: text
    position: object (location in document)
    createdAt: datetime
    resolved: boolean
  }
  
  Versions {
    versionId: string (primary key)
    documentId: string (foreign key to Documents)
    versionNumber: int
    timestamp: datetime
    userId: string (foreign key to Users)
    snapshot: object (complete document state at this version)
    description: string (optional version description)
  }
  ```

## Scalability Considerations

### Document Service Scalability
- **Sharding**: Partition documents across multiple database instances
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed documents in memory
- **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas for document retrieval

### Collaboration Service Scalability
- **Channel-based Scaling**: Group users editing the same document into channels
- **Stateful Service**: Maintain session state for each active document
- **Sticky Sessions**: Route users of the same document to the same server
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more collaboration servers as load increases

## Bottlenecks and Solutions

### Real-time Collaboration at Scale
- **Problem**: High message volume with many concurrent editors
- **Solution**:
  - Batch small operations before broadcasting
  - Implement rate limiting for rapid edits
  - Use efficient binary protocols for WebSocket communication
  - Prioritize operations from active cursor positions

### Large Document Handling
- **Problem**: Very large documents can be slow to load and edit
- **Solution**:
  - Implement incremental loading (load only visible portions)
  - Use sparse arrays and efficient data structures
  - Compress document content in transit and storage
  - Implement pagination for very large documents

### Offline Editing Conflicts
- **Problem**: Complex conflicts when syncing offline changes
- **Solution**:
  - Maintain operation log during offline editing
  - Use three-way merge algorithms when reconnecting
  - Provide conflict resolution UI for unresolvable conflicts
  - Implement intention preservation in conflict resolution

## Caching Strategy

- **Document Cache**: Cache frequently accessed documents in memory
- **Operation Cache**: Cache recent operations for efficient transformation
- **User Presence Cache**: Cache user presence information
- **Access Control Cache**: Cache document permissions for quick authorization

## Data Replication and Consistency

- **Document Replication**: Replicate documents across multiple regions
- **Operation Log Replication**: Ensure operation logs are replicated for durability
- **Consistency Model**:
  - Strong consistency for access control operations
  - Causal consistency for document operations (using vector clocks)
  - Eventual consistency for non-critical metadata

## Sharding Strategy

- **Document-based Sharding**: Shard by documentId to keep all operations for a document together
- **User-based Sharding**: Shard user data by userId
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use document-based sharding for active documents and user-based for metadata

## Real-time Collaboration Implementation

### WebSocket Communication
- Establish persistent WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Implement heartbeat mechanism to detect disconnections
- Use binary protocols (Protocol Buffers, MessagePack) for efficiency

### Operational Transformation (OT) Details
- Each operation has:
  - Type (insert, delete, format)
  - Position (where in the document)
  - Content (what is being changed)
  - Author (who made the change)
  - Timestamp (when the change was made)
- Server acts as the central authority for operation ordering
- Transformation functions handle all possible operation pairs

### Collaborative Cursor Tracking
- Track and broadcast cursor positions of all active users
- Use lightweight messages for cursor updates
- Apply color coding to identify different users' cursors
- Implement throttling for cursor position updates

## Version Control System

- **Snapshot-based Versioning**: Store complete document snapshots at key points
- **Operation-based History**: Store operations between snapshots
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Combine nearest snapshot with subsequent operations
- **Compaction**: Periodically compact operation history to save space
- **Named Versions**: Allow users to name important versions

## Offline Support

- **Service Workers**: Cache document data for offline access
- **IndexedDB**: Store operations locally during offline editing
- **Sync Queue**: Queue operations for sync when connection is restored
- **Conflict Detection**: Compare server and client version vectors during sync

## Fault Tolerance and Reliability

- **Multi-Region Deployment**: Deploy across multiple geographic regions
- **Operation Journaling**: Log all operations before applying them
- **Automated Recovery**: Implement recovery procedures for service failures
- **State Reconciliation**: Verify document state consistency periodically
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain regular backups of all documents

## Security Considerations

- **Document Encryption**: Encrypt documents at rest
- **Transport Security**: Use TLS for all communications
- **Fine-grained Access Control**: Implement detailed permission system
- **Audit Logging**: Log all access and modifications for security auditing
