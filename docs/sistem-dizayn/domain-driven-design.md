# Domain-Driven Design

## Overview

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is an approach to software development that focuses on understanding the business domain and creating a model that reflects it.
- Introduced by Eric Evans in his book "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software."
- Emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts to develop a shared understanding.

## Core Concepts

- **Ubiquitous Language**: A common language used by all team members to connect domain experts with developers.
- **Bounded Context**: A clear boundary within which a particular domain model applies.
- **Context Mapping**: Defining relationships between different bounded contexts.
- **Domain Model**: A conceptual model of the domain that incorporates both behavior and data.

## Building Blocks

- **Entities**: Objects defined by their identity rather than their attributes.
- **Value Objects**: Objects defined by their attributes, with no conceptual identity.
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of entities and value objects with clear boundaries and a root entity.
- **Repositories**: Mechanisms for accessing domain objects from a database.
- **Domain Events**: Events that domain experts care about.
- **Services**: Operations that don't naturally belong to any entity or value object.
- **Factories**: Methods for creating complex objects or aggregates.

## Strategic Design

- **Bounded Contexts**: Dividing a large model into manageable parts.
- **Context Maps**: Documenting relationships between bounded contexts.
- **Core Domain**: Identifying and focusing on the most valuable part of the system.
- **Subdomains**: Dividing the problem space into different areas of expertise.

## Tactical Design

- **Aggregates**: Defining transaction boundaries and consistency rules.
- **Domain Events**: Capturing and communicating significant changes.
- **Anti-corruption Layer**: Protecting the model from external influences.
- **Repositories and Factories**: Managing object lifecycle.

## Benefits

- **Alignment with Business**: Software closely reflects the business domain.
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries and well-defined models make the system easier to maintain.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Ubiquitous language facilitates communication between technical and domain experts.
- **Flexibility**: Focus on the domain allows for adaptation to changing business needs.

## Challenges

- **Learning Curve**: Requires deep understanding of both the domain and DDD principles.
- **Complexity**: Can be overkill for simple applications.
- **Time Investment**: Requires significant upfront investment in domain modeling.
- **Team Buy-in**: Requires commitment from both technical and domain experts.
