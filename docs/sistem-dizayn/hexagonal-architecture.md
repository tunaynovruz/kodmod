# Hexagonal Architecture

## Overview

- **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports and Adapters) is an architectural pattern that allows an application to be equally driven by users, programs, automated tests, or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases.
- Introduced by Alistair Cockburn in 2005 to increase the maintainability of applications.
- The name comes from the graphical representation, which is typically drawn as a hexagon.

## Core Concepts

- **Domain**: The central part of the application containing the business logic.
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define how the application interacts with the outside world.
- **Adapters**: Implementations of ports that connect the application to external systems.
- **Inside/Outside Principle**: Clear separation between the inside (domain) and outside (infrastructure) of the application.

## Types of Ports and Adapters

- **Primary/Driving Ports**: Interfaces that allow external actors to interact with the application (e.g., API controllers, UI).
- **Primary/Driving Adapters**: Components that use primary ports to interact with the application (e.g., REST controllers, CLI).
- **Secondary/Driven Ports**: Interfaces that the application uses to interact with external systems (e.g., repository interfaces).
- **Secondary/Driven Adapters**: Implementations of secondary ports that connect to external systems (e.g., database repositories).

## Benefits

- **Testability**: The domain can be tested in isolation from external dependencies.
- **Flexibility**: External components can be replaced without affecting the domain.
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- **Technology Independence**: The domain is not tied to specific technologies or frameworks.
- **Balanced Development**: Multiple teams can work on different adapters simultaneously.

## Implementation Strategies

- **Dependency Injection**: Inject adapters into the domain through ports.
- **Inversion of Control**: The domain defines interfaces that adapters must implement.
- **Clean Architecture**: A variation that emphasizes the dependency rule (dependencies point inward).
- **Onion Architecture**: A similar approach with concentric layers around the domain.

## Challenges

- **Complexity**: Can introduce additional complexity for simple applications.
- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of ports, adapters, and dependency inversion.
- **Overhead**: May require more code than simpler architectures.
- **Abstraction Leakage**: Difficult to completely isolate the domain from external concerns.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Applications**: Where business logic is complex and needs to be isolated.
- **Systems with Multiple Interfaces**: Applications that need to support various types of clients.
- **Legacy System Modernization**: Gradually replacing components while preserving business logic.
- **Microservices**: Ensuring each service has well-defined boundaries and interfaces.
