# SOLID Principles

## Overview

- **SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
- These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental guidelines for object-oriented design.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
- Each class should focus on doing one thing well, rather than trying to do multiple things.
- Benefits: Easier to understand, test, and maintain; reduces coupling.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
- Often achieved through abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the desirable properties of the program.
- Ensures that inheritance is used correctly.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- Prevents classes from implementing methods they don't need.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- Promotes loose coupling and makes the system more modular and testable.

## Benefits of SOLID

- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend code over time.
- **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand.
- **Flexibility**: System is more adaptable to changing requirements.
- **Testability**: Components are more isolated, making them easier to test.
